# CMB Scales & Constants Analysis Results

This directory contains the results of various analyses performed on CMB data, focusing on mathematical scales and constants, with proper statistical testing and corrections.

## Scales & Constants Analysis with BH Correction

The file `cmb_scales_constants_analysis_results_with_bh.md` contains the complete results of analyzing CMB data (WMAP and Planck datasets) for mathematical patterns and constant relationships. The analysis includes:

- Testing multiple mathematical sequences (Fibonacci, Primes, Powers of 2)
- Testing multiple mathematical constants (phi, sqrt2, sqrt3, pi, e, etc.)
- 10,000 surrogate simulations per test for statistical robustness
- Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons
- Both p-values and z-scores for each test

Key findings include significant relationships between:
1. Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio (phi)
2. Powers of 2 sequence and the constant 2

These results are consistent across both WMAP and Planck datasets, with even stronger statistical significance in the higher-resolution Planck data.
