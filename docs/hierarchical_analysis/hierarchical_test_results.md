## Key Observations

1. **Identical Results in Both Datasets**: Both WMAP and Planck analyses produced identical significant results, confirming that the mathematical organization in the CMB data is consistent across different measurements.

2. **Scale 55 Centrality**: Scale 55 appears in significant relationships across multiple mathematical constants (√2, φ, and π), suggesting it has a special role in the hierarchical information structure of the CMB.

3. **Fibonacci Sequence Prominence**: Many significant relationships involve Fibonacci numbers (34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377), suggesting the Fibonacci sequence may play a role in organizing the CMB power spectrum.

4. **Sqrt2 Dominance**: Square root of 2 shows both the highest number of scale pairs and several of the most statistically significant results, particularly in relationships involving Scale 55.

5. **Hierarchical Organization**: The significant scale pairs show a clear hierarchical pattern, with key scales (55, 89, 144, 233, 377) forming hubs of relationships organized by different mathematical constants.
